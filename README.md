# NLP---TEXT-CLASSIFICATION

Objective: 
Develop machine learning models to classify emotions in text samples.

Dataset:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HWczIICsMpaL8EJyu48ZvRFcXx3_pcnb/view?usp=drive_link

The following steps have been performed :

1. Loading and Preprocessing
Loaded the dataset and performed necessary preprocessing steps. This includes text cleaning, tokenization, and removal of stopwords.
Explained the preprocessing techniques used and their impact on model performance.

2. Feature Extraction
Implemented feature extraction using TfidfVectorizer.

3. Model Development
Trained the following machine learning models
a)Naive Bayes b)Support Vector Machine

4. Model Comparison 
Evaluated the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score). 

Provided the code in a Jupyter Notebook format.
